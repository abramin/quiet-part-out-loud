A secret dream of mine has always been to be a philosopher, but more of the robe wearing forest dweller variety instead of the tweed wearing academic. It's a project I've consistently avoided starting most of my life, until a recent break from work gave me the free time to think more about it. Having a strong autodidactic streak means I dabble widely and sometimes deeply but without system. To paraphrase Woody Allen, I know everything about Abacuses, quite a lot about Albatrosses, but upon reaching the Bs I was distracted by a new project.

So having some free time, I designed my ideal self-study curriculum (attending a bricks and mortar university not being feasible) - a multi-disciplinary curriculum spanning anthropology, psychology and philosophy with suitable extra material from mathematics, neuroscience,and religion where relevant. I came up with a 4 year curriculum that included in depth reading, assignments, and practical exercises (e.g. data analysis labs). Perhaps I should mention now that I didn’t spend weeks scouring university syllabi, sifting and sorting and building my ideal curriculum. Instead I worked with ChatGPT to design it in approximately 15 minutes. I spent a few more days refining it, making sure it covered the breadth of my interests (more Schopenhauer than Hegel for example). I also worked with the AI to design the first module - Mind, Culture, and the Foundations of Psychological Science. 

I should mention that I'm currently in my first year of a psychology degree - yes, another study project (I have a problem). Early in that course, I posted about using AI as a learning mentor. The response was swift and dismissive: not only was AI-mediation suspect, but the AI's suggestion that I read Virginia Woolf was nonsense. (“Virginia Woolf has NOTHING to do with psychology!”). Being of a defiant frame of mind, I set out to prove them wrong - that, based on my experience so far, AI (used correctly) would be a boon to self-study. To ensure I was taken seriously, I decided upon a formal study of the degree itself as an exercise in auto-ethnography: I would observe myself learning with AI and record my findings (I don’t know what solipsism means since that is covered in a later module). 

Now as part of a good study, a smaller pilot project can help assess the feasibility of the project design. And so (again with the help of some AI coaches), I came up with [this pilot](https://github.com/abramin/cultural-cognitive-science/blob/main/pilot/pilot.md) - a seven week project comparing pure (no AI) auto-didactism with AI-Mediated study. The course itself is a miniature version of the degree as a whole, so includes readings in anthropology, psychology and philosophy. 

What I want to explore with the pilot is how it feels studying using only a text and my brain without automatically reaching for google or ChatGPT every time I have a question (or more realistically get bored or distracted). Will I sit with confusion longer? Will I make different kinds of notes? Will I retain things differently when I've had to puzzle them out alone? I want to carry that feeling of self-reliance into the second phase, where I can use AI to help clarify things, to augment instead of replace my own thinking.

At the very least, I'll have an excuse to spend seven weeks with texts I find fascinating. At most? Well, I'm beginning to suspect that being a forest-dwelling philosopher doesn't require official credentials - just the willingness to think carefully about questions that matter, and to document what happens when you do. Whether that makes me unofficially qualified or merely self-deluded, the pilot should at least provide evidence one way or the other.

I'll be documenting the process here as I go. If you're interested in the question of how we learn, or how we might learn differently with AI as interlocutor, I'd welcome your observations along the way.
