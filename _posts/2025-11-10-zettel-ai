Before starting my new degree in Psychology, I thought about ways to get the most out of the experience. 
My interests have always been catholic, everything from anarchism to zoology, with a special interest in the middle of the 
alphabet - magic, mathematics, mysticism, mythology, philosophy,physics, and psychology.

I usually relied on traditional note-taking - filling notebooks with scribbled, barely legibke notes, which I then packed away and never returned to. 
Taking the notes was the point as a way of processing the information I was reading, but I never found much use in my notes after that.

I first came across Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten method this summer, it felt like discovering the missing half of my brain. 
One idea per note. Notes that link to each other. A web of thought that grows organically over time.

I looked for digital tools but found them clunky and not specifically built for zettelkasten.
Handwritten notes are better anyway - there's definitely a link between writing something by hand and it becoming part of you.

However, I worried that I would soon lose track of all my notes and need to continually reread them in order to look for new connections.

Existing digital tools were no help - they could store connections between notes, but they couldn’t suggest them.

That’s where the idea for Zettel-AI began.

What if the system itself could propose subtle associations — not the obvious “bird → feather” kind, 
but the kind that spark genuine insight: fermentation → jazz - because...
maybe fermentation is a living process and jazz is as well, so creating jazz is like letting your creativity ferment?

## From Notes to Networks

So I built Zettel-AI, a simple experiment that evolved into a personal thinking companion.

At its core, it’s a place to write — short, atomic notes called zettels.

Each note can have:
a title and body,
one or more tags (themes or topics), 
and links to other notes that share a conceptual thread.

But the magic happens when you create a new note.
In the background, Zettel-AI compares your writing with everything you’ve written before, looking for potential relationships. 
It doesn’t give you one answer — it gives you possibilities.
“Maybe this connects to that.”

You decide whether it’s meaningful or not.

## A Thinking Partner, Not a Search Engine

I wanted the AI to behave more like a psychological mirror than a search tool.
Instead of giving you the most similar note, it offers interesting resonances,
notes that share conceptual texture, even if the words differ completely.

Over time, this creates an evolving web of your own thinking.

You can:

explore by tags or themes,

search for concepts or phrases,

see suggested links with possible reasons,

generate possible summaries of connected notes,

and see your thought-map visualized in an interactive graph.

## What It Feels Like to Use

When you start writing, you’re just collecting fragments.
But after a few weeks, something strange happens: your notes start talking to each other.

You might open a note about “The Trickster Archetype” and notice a suggested link to one about “Creative Destruction.” 
You read both, nod, and realize they’re two expressions of the same psychological principle.

Then you add a third note — “Play as Adaptation” — and the network shifts again.
New clusters form. Old ones merge. The map of your thinking changes shape.

That’s the feeling I wanted to build — not a database of thoughts, but a living topology of meaning.
