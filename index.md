# The Quiet Part Out Loud  
*A Psychology Student’s Journal of Learning and Living*

## Welcome  

Hello, and welcome to *The Quiet Part Out Loud*.  

I’m a psychology student with a background in technology and coaching. This blog is my companion through a degree in Psychology with Counselling, and beyond. It’s where I’ll reflect on what I’m studying, how it connects with daily life, and the “shadow tasks” that surface along the way—those quieter, often overlooked aspects of learning, growth, and being human.  

Here you’ll find a mixture of:  
- **Study reflections** — translating theory into practice.  
- **Personal insights** — where coursework collides with lived experience.  
- **Connections outward** — linking psychology with philosophy, literature, coaching, and culture.

## About the Blog  

Why *The Quiet Part Out Loud*? Because much of psychology—whether theory, practice, or self-work—turns on what usually remains unsaid. By putting words to these quiet parts, we can begin to see them, share them, and maybe even learn from them.
