## Writing Exercises
---

### Week 1 — Orientation

* Write a short essay: *“What is psychology for?”* Answer first as the OU defines it, then as you feel it personally.

### Week 2 — Myths & Methods

* Essay: *“The role of myth in everyday life.”* Compare one psychological myth to a cultural myth you know (e.g., in fitness or spirituality).
* Critical response: *“Why received wisdom is persistent.”* Use examples from both psychology and your PT practice.
* Thought experiment: Write about a world in which all psychological myths are literally true. What would daily life look like?

### Week 3 — Intelligence

* Exposition: *“Gardner’s intelligences as seen in my own life.”* Choose two intelligences and illustrate them from your personal history.
* Comparative piece: *“Binet vs Gardner.”* Early IQ tests vs multiple intelligences—who serves human flourishing better?
